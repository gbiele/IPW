	\newline Q6 = MoBa questionnaire at child age 3, Q1 =  MoBa questionnaire at pregnancy week 20, F = Moba fathers' questionnaire (week 20), MBRN = Medical Birth Registry of Norway, SS = sum score. SGA = small for gestational age. Mothers' smoking and drinking behavior refers to the first 20 weeks of the pregnancy. 
	\newline Outcome = outcome variable, Birth = Birth related exposures, Mental health = exposures related to mothers' and father's mental health, Legal Drugs = exposures from drinking and smoking, control = adjustment variables, Pred.part./ctrl. = predictors of participation (control variables in non-weighted analyses).
	Variable names starting with m refer to mothers, f refers to fathers, and c refers to children. All continuous and count variables except parity were re-scaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.}
