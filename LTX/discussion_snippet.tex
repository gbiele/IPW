This can be problematic, because IPW corrected estimates can be biased in the presence of unknown confounders, or when participation predictors do not predict participation well. Here, we are less concerned with unknown confounders, because those would also be present if population data were available.   

It is therefore possible that the results do not indicate bias in estimates from adjusted regressions, but that the IPW results are biased. However, whereas IPW can introduce bias when weights are inappropriate because participation probabilities are not estimated well \supercite{Seaman2013-rj}, this is unlikely the case in our study because the selection model predicted participation well.
